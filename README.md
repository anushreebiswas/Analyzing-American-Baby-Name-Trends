## Overview

Choosing a baby name is a deeply personal decision, but it's also influenced by culture, tradition, and trends. This project explores **American baby name trends** using SQL on a dataset that spans from **1920 to 2020**, originally sourced from the **United States Social Security Administration** and preprocessed by Izzy Weber.

We investigate the **popularity**, **persistence**, and **evolution** of baby names across a century and discover what names stood the test of time and what trends are shaping modern choices.

- **Window Functions** – For calculating ranks and cumulative sums  
- **Subqueries & CTEs** – For isolating top names and advanced filtering  
- **PostgreSQL** – relational database engine for analysis

- **Classify Naming Patterns** – Categorize names into "Classic," "Semi-classic," "Trendy," etc.  
- **Explore Gender Trends** – Discover top names by gender over the decades  
- **Track Name Lifecycles** – Use cumulative sums to study names like "Olivia" over time  
- **Rank Top Male Names** – Identify which male names dominated each year and for how long
